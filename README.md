# CryptoPunk Pixels

## Why this repo?
Initially, I wanted to write an article about how I created the LoadingPunks collection.
However, it's more engaging and informative to demonstrate it through examples.
So, this repository does not create LoadingPunks, but it does include features that I needed to write the assembling feature (creating the GIF).

## What can you do with this repo?
This repository could be a good starting point for your own CryptoPunks derivative collection.
It allows you to get all pixel data layer by layer and even has the possibility to overwrite default colors.

## How I created LoadingPunks
### Extracting pixel data
Because I wanted to "load" each CryptoPunk layer by layer, I had to analyze all available attributes per gender; attributes go by gender, and Zombies, Apes, and Aliens are classified as Males.
I could automatically extract each 10,000 CryptoPunks and retrieve all pixels that have a different color than the background color, but that way I would only have flat images. Therefore, I came up with the idea to analyze each attribute manually and enter x-y coordinates in separate CSV files.
To avoid looking at my screen with a microscope and counting each pixel on screen, I created a simple function that overlays the CryptoPunk with x-y coordinates for each pixel. This allowed me to quickly see which x-y coordinates (and color) belong to a certain attribute.

_Insert CryptoPunk PNG files in /data/originals/ that are 336x336 pixels in dimension.
I've added one CryptoPunk solely for demonstration purposes._

With this repo you could do the same by running the following command in your kernel, although the x-y results you can already find in `data/properties`.

```text
php index.php rasterize 15
```

### Pulling pixel information
Next to attributes pixel data, I've also separated pixels for the skin, the type (silouete) and eyes, nose + mouth.
When I had all the information available, it was just a matter to collect all x-y + color data in the correct order.
With repo you can collect the same data and use in your own derivative.

_Tip: end your command with `pretty` to get readable output._

## Create your own collection
With this data you have a good starting point for your own CryptoPunk derivative.
Think out of the box, this repo is not meant to create a copy of CryptoPunks, but create something more fun with it like I did with the following collections on ETH:
- LoadingPunks
- PipingPunks
- ShapedPunks &
- OpepePunks
